**Passionate Penetration Tester Seeking Opportunities**

Hi there,

I’m Nithesh Dhakshanamoorthy, a recent MSc Information Security graduate from Royal Holloway, University of London. With a graduate route visa valid until January 2026, I have the legal right to work in the UK. My enthusiasm for offensive security and penetration testing drives me to continuously expand my knowledge and skills in this field.

Though I lack professional experience, I’ve dedicated significant time to honing my abilities by solving numerous Hack The Box and TryHackMe challenges and creating vulnerable machines in my own lab environment. I’m also committed to advancing my qualifications, having scheduled the eCPPTv3 exam for mid-August, followed by immediate preparation for the CPTS certification.

I am eager to join a team where I can contribute my skills and grow further in the field of cybersecurity. I thrive in dynamic and collaborative environments and am passionate about delivering top-notch security testing services.

I look forward to discussing how I can be a valuable addition to your team.

Best regards, Nithesh Dhakshanamoorthy
