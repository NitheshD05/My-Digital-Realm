Target IP: 172.16.116.100
--------------------------------------

Maximum Potential Points: 40

You have agreed with the client to perform an external black box penetration test against their Microsoft Windows Active Directory infrastructure. 

The final objective of the Active Directory penetration test is to gain Domain Administrator level rights on the network. The Active Directory network can be located at the following IP addresses:


172.16.116.100
172.16.116.102
192.168.116.101

Main Objectives:

- Get Administrative interactive access to the MS02 client machine and obtain the proof.txt file in a valid way, note that there is no local.txt file.
- Get Administrative interactive access to the MS01 client machine and obtain local.txt and proof.txt files in a valid way.
- Get Administrative interactive access to the Domain Controller and obtain the proof.txt file in a valid way, note that there is no local.txt file.
- Submit local.txt and proof.txt files in the Control Panel.

Documentation Requirements:

- Document each step and command of your attack in a way that it can be replicated following a "copy/paste" approach
- Create screenshots showing various steps and stages of the attack performed
- Create a valid screenshot showing the content of proof.txt and the machine IP address
- Provide the link or the copy of the script/exploits being used
- Document any changes done to the original scripts or exploits being used
- Provide a summary and overview of the vulnerabilities found in performed attacks and exploitation process. You must show all steps executed against the entire Active Directory domain used to obtain Domain Administrator privileges. 

To ensure the stability of the Active Directory network, it is not possible to revert a single specific VM. Instead, reverting any of the target machines in the AD network will revert all the machines at once.
IMPORTANT NOTE: Please ensure to wait for 5 minutes after reverting the machines to ensure all necessary services are working properly.

Note that reverting all machines can take an estimated five to seven (5-7) minutes.

Please note that not all machines will respond to ICMP/ping requests.
Should you believe a machine is not working properly after a revert, please make sure to follow the Exam Contact Protocol outlined in the OSCP Exam Guide.

There are no dependencies between the Active Directory infrastructure and the freestanding hosts.
